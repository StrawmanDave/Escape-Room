# Escape-Room
Final project in Programming 1400.

Idea/asspirations
As someone who enjoys puzzles and thinking outside the box.
I would like to build an escape room.
This escape room would have many puzzles and hidden information that interconnect.
It would also have a time limit for figuring out.
There could be mazes, combination guessing games as well simple typing trials.

I would also try to make it so it is infinite and each room keeps getting more challenging with more puzzles and locks to figure out.
Then it will take the score you got on each puzzle/lock based on time and accuracy for typing.
It will also have how many rooms you got through in the time limit.

This could be close to the ideas the labs have and what I have learned. 
It would be really entertaining to have my friends play it and see what score they get.
A lot of it would be random. It also does not seem very challenging to do. 

Overview and reflection: 


Outline/Brainstorm
The Escape room will start off asking for a difficulty of 1 to 8. This will be the length of the escape room.
Each letter in a random word, witch they chose how long the word will be, will be shown after solving a puzzle.
Each of the random words will have something in comman so if the person wants to get a better score on the game they can skip levels.
If they skip a level it will not show them the letter.
The final part of the escape room is unscrambling the letters they have seen so they must enter the word witch will be there key to escape.
